# Primitive building blocks

- Point
- Vector
- Ray

Point: is a 3 dimensional coordinate

```java
Point p = new Point(1, 1, 1);
```

Vector: is a structures based on point

```java
Vector v = new Vector(1, 1, 1); // -> (1, 1, 1)
```

Ray: is an infinite vectore

```java
Ray r = new Ray(0, 0, 1);
```

## Utils

Utils is a helping structure for defining accuracy for a double and some other features

```java
Util.isZero(Math.Pow(0.1, 40)); // output: true
```
